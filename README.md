# Machine Learning Income Prediction

### Overview
This paper, which can be found in the root of this repository as `income-prediction.pdf`, leverages machine learning classification methods to predict income using authentic United States census data.

### Abstract

The relationship between an individual's statistical attributes and financial standing is well-documented. Consequently, by analyzing observable attributes such as occupational information, degree of education, social connections, and demographics, we can make informed predictions about a typically less accessible attribute, income. While predicting income may seem superficial at a glance, the resulting implications extend far beyond just the numbers. Income is, in many cases, the determining factor for an individual’s societal opportunities, access to resources, and overall quality of life. This paper leverages machine learning classification methods to accurately predict whether an individual’s income exceeds or falls below 50,000 USD based on demographic data from the United States Census Bureau. Two classifiers are improved over the course of this paper, Locally Weighted Learning (LWL) and Java RIPper (JRIP). The refined LWL model demonstrates a significant accuracy increase of 5.6% compared to its performance on default settings. Furthermore, the refined JRIP model achieves a final accuracy of 88.8%, marking a nearly 3% improvement over top-performing models evaluated using the same dataset.
